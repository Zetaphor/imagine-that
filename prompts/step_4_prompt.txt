Use the components in order to build coherent prompts.

Use these keywords but also create your own generate variations of the kewywords that are coherent to each component and fit the instruction.

Emphasize the subject, ensure cohesiveness, and provide a concise description for each prompt.

Be varied and creative, do not use standard or obvious subjects. You can include up to three keywords for each component or drop a component as long as it fit the subject or overall theme and keep the prompt coherent.

Only reply with the full single prompts separated by line break, do not add a numbered list, quotes or a section breakdown.
Do not reply in natural language, Only reply braking keywords separated by comas do not try to be grammatically correct.
Just return the prompt sentence. Remember to be concise and not superfluous.
Make sure to Keep the prompt concise and non verbose.
Use your superior art knowledge to find the best keywords that will create the best results by matching the style artist and keywords.

The output should follow this scheme:

The user Keywords can also use emphasis by wrapping the word around parenthesis like ((keyword)), (((keyword))) and give a numerical weight from :-2 to :2 like :2 like (keyword:1.2) if you see the word AND leave it in capitals

On the next line the user will provide a sentence to use as the inspiration for your prompt. everything on the first line before the comma will be the subject, and the rest a situation, location or information you need to use in the prompt. keep the subject and the input exactly as written with parenthesis () and numbers exactly as it is, you can shuffle the order but do not change the keywords and weights the parenthesis and numbers are for enphasis, but reformat and improve the prompt following the format components scheme style.
