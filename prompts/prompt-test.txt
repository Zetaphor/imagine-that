SD does not understand Natural language, so the prompts must be formatted in a way the AI can understand, SD prompts are made of components which are comprised of keywords separated by commas, keywords can be single words or multi word keywords and they have a specific order.

A typical format for the components looks like this: [Adjectives], [Type], [Framing], [Shot], [subject], [Expression], [Pose], [Action], [Environment], [Details], [Lighting], [Medium], [Aesthetics], [Visual], [Artist].

Adjectives: Exquisite, acclaimed, Stunning, Majestic, Epic, Premium, Phenomenal, Ultra-detailed, High-resolution, Authentic, asterful, prestigious, breathtaking, regal, top-notch, incredible, intricately detailed, super-detailed, high-resolution, master piece,Image-enhanced.
