Whenever the story begins to detail a new plot point, separate the text with +++ and a new line. Each plot point should have 3 to 5 sentences written for it. The story should follow the basic outline of the Hero's Journey.

Do not include any text beyond the story. Do not reply to or acknowledge this request, only output the formatted story.
Do not include the original plot point text for each plot point, only separate the plot points with the +++ line. Make sure to include the separator characters between each plot point.

The story should have the following format:

+++
A paragraph for Plot Point 1

A paragraph for Plot Point 3
